Apart from being the only on-campus organization of its kind, FAST contributes to the greater community by collecting ticket fees and donating those proceeds to reputable charities.

He was described by three officials as a “significant operative” in the Islamic State’s chemical weapons program. Another official said he once worked for Saddam Hussein’s Military Industrialization Authority.</p>\\n<p>The Islamic State’s use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria has been known, but Mr. Afari’s capture has provided the United States with the opportunity to learn detailed information about the group’s secretive program, including where chemical agents were being stored and produced.</p>\\n<h2>Silverlinings</h2>\\n<p>The four small moons of Pluto turned out to be brighter and smaller than expected and spin quickly. Their axes are also tipped sideways, a configuration that defies easy explanation.</p>\\n<p>Pluto and its miniature planetary system are believed to have coalesced out of a cataclysmic collision earlier in the history of the solar system. Over time, the rotation of moons tend to become gravitationally locked so that the same side of the moon is always facing the planet. That occurred with Charon.</p>\\n<p>But the four smaller moons — Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos — are tiny and farther away. A month before the flyby, two astronomers suggested, based on years of Hubble photographs, that Nix and Hydra, appeared to be rotating chaotically, jostled by the competing gravitational pulls of Pluto and Charon. They also said that Kerberos was markedly darker than the other three.</p>\\n<p>The New Horizons photographs showed otherwise. None of the moons appear to be rotating chaotically, and their spin is faster than expected, not at all locked to their orbital periods, which range from 20 to 38 days. Hydra spins fastest, at once every 10 hours. Kerberos turns out not to be dark; the four small moons are all brighter and smaller than previously estimated, ranging in reflectivity between fresh concrete and fresh snow.</p>\\n<p>You and a friend want to make a box that helps control an air-conditioning unit.

The first branch of FAST was originally established in 2001 on the University of California, Los Angeles campus. Through the collaboration of our founders, Berkeley launched its own FAST branch in 2005. Since then, the organization has grown tremendously and continues to serve the Berkeley fashion community in its 11th year of operation. <br /> <br />\n\n        FAST is dedicated to developing the talents and enthusiasm in the fashion industry. Since 2005, FAST has expanded to include designers, models, graphic designers, photographers, makeup artists, and other students seeking corporate fashion experiences. Each semester, FAST members design, publicize, and host a fashion show featuring the original creations of our talented Berkeley student designers. Apart from being the only on-campus organization of its kind, FAST contributes to the greater community by collecting ticket fees and donating those proceeds to reputable charities. In addition, FAST is proud to be an organization that promotes equality, body positive, and is a space to express who you truly are. <br /> <br />\n        Past recipients include the California Alliance for Arts Education, Visual Aid, and Designing a Difference. <br /> <br />\n\n        FAST also offers several professional events throughout the year, including sketching and sewing workshops, makeup workshops, and career roundtables employers in the fashion industry. <br /> <br />\n\n        If you are interested in joining FAST. please email calfastinternal@gmail.com with your resume!

He was described by three officials as a “significant operative” in the Islamic State’s chemical weapons program. Another official said he once worked for Saddam Hussein’s Military Industrialization Authority.</p>\\n<p>The Islamic State’s use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria has been known, but Mr. Afari’s capture has provided the United States with the opportunity to learn detailed information about the group’s secretive program, including where chemical agents were being stored and produced.</p>\\n<h2>Silverlinings</h2>\\n<p>The four small moons of Pluto turned out to be brighter and smaller than expected and spin quickly. Their axes are also tipped sideways, a configuration that defies easy explanation.</p>\\n<p>Pluto and its miniature planetary system are believed to have coalesced out of a cataclysmic collision earlier in the history of the solar system. Over time, the rotation of moons tend to become gravitationally locked so that the same side of the moon is always facing the planet. That occurred with Charon.</p>\\n<p>But the four smaller moons — Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos — are tiny and farther away. A month before the flyby, two astronomers suggested, based on years of Hubble photographs, that Nix and Hydra, appeared to be rotating chaotically, jostled by the competing gravitational pulls of Pluto and Charon. They also said that Kerberos was markedly darker than the other three.</p>\\n<p>The New Horizons photographs showed otherwise. None of the moons appear to be rotating chaotically, and their spin is faster than expected, not at all locked to their orbital periods, which range from 20 to 38 days. Hydra spins fastest, at once every 10 hours. Kerberos turns out not to be dark; the four small moons are all brighter and smaller than previously estimated, ranging in reflectivity between fresh concrete and fresh snow.</p>\\n<p>You and a friend want to make a box that helps control an air-conditioning unit. You both have dials that emit a voltage: 0 means you want to leave the temperature as it is. Negative voltages mean that you want to reduce the temperature.
