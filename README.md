### Overview
This is the website for FAST at Berkeley. This is a guide to managing the website. We use the static site generator [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). If you're curious about what a static site generator is, you can read more [here](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators). You should be familiar with Git, Github, and the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to maintain this website.
